Login to ambari using the credentials you noted above.\n    2. Navigate to the \"Files view\" tool  (Available from the toolbar within the \"Views\" dropdown menu to the right of the \"Admin\" menu)\n    3. Verify you see the assets listed in the table above in the file browser.  You will create data assets in DSX that correspond to these files.\n\n## 1.3. Download copies of required Jupyter notebooks to your personal system\nIn this step you will open an existing project in DSX Local that is shared with your user ID.  You will then open and download Jupyter notebooks to your local system so you can reuse them in the following steps.\n1. Login to DSX Local as your assigned team user.  \n2. You will see a shared project called \"BankChurn\".  *Note:  Do not perform your lab excercises in this project, you only have \"viewer\" priveleges for this project.  You will open, then download the notebooks from this project.*\n3. Click into the BankChurn project, then click \"Assets\".  You should see a list of three notebooks contained in the project.\n4. Download both the __Churn Visualization Python HDP__ and __Churn ML Training Notebook Scala HDP LR__ notebooks.  \nTo do this, first open the notebook by clicking its link, then download it using the `File -> Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb)` menu option\n>*Note: Remember the download location for these files, you will need these files in a following step.*\n5. After downloading each .ipynb file, exit the Jupyter notebook by clicking on the \"BankChurn\" project name in the link bar.  \n6. To conserve system resources, stop the kernel that was launched when you opened each notebook (shown as a green circles) by selecting \"Stop Kernel\" from the 3-dot menu to the right of the notebook name in the assets list.",

Create a new DSXL project, create data source connection to HDP and create associated data assets\nPerform the following steps to prepare your DSX Local environment for the lab excercises\n## 2.1 Create a new DSX project\n1. Return to your \"All Projects\" list either by clicking \"View all Projects\" from the the 3 horizontal bar menu at the top-left corner of the screen, or by clicking \"Projects\" in the navigation link area of the screen.\n2. Click \"New Project\" and in the \"Name\" field enter \"__[TeamLetter]__Team_BankChurnLab\" (e.g. ATeam_BankChurnLab, BTeam_BankChurnLab, etc)\n>Note: As you progress through the lab excercises, you will see an asterisk \\* next to the project's name and the message *Changes made -- \nYou have local changes that you can commit* will be displayed. DSXL internally uses git  to manage project changes.  You can commit changes if you would like to but it is not necessary for the excercises in this lab.  If you did have collaborators added to the project, they would not see any additions or changes made to the project until you commit your changes to the project.  \n\n## 2.2 Create a new data source connection to HDP and add associated data sets to the project.\nYour DSX Local system is already configured to connect securely to the HDP HDFS system using the Knox protocol, but each project must contain a \"Data source\" with the correct connection information for HDFS.  Once the data source is created, you will add \"data sets\" using the new data source.\n1. From within your new project, click \"Data Sources\" \n2. Click \"add data source\"\n3. Enter the following information exactly as shown below then click the \"Create\" button at the lower right of the screen:\n    * Data source name (this can be any text): HDP HDFS\n    * Data source type (dropdown): HDFS - HDP\n    * HDFS host: hdp1.atat.ibm.com\n    * HDFS port:  8020\n    * WebHDFS URL: https://hdp1.atat.ibm.com:8443/gateway/dsx/webhdfs/v1\n    >*When you click \"Create\", the new data source name will be displayed*\n4. Click the name of the new data source to enter the \"View/Edit data source\" screen\n5. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click \"Add data set\"\n6. Click \"Browse\" - a window opens showing the contents of HDP HDFS, the same content you previewed earlier\n>*If you don't see a list of files open up, check your data source to be sure you correctly entered the settings listed above*\n7. Navigate to \"/data/financialservices/churn/\" in the file tree\n8. For each of CSV files listed in the table in step 1.2 above, do the following\n    * Select the file and select \"Open\"\n    * For \"Remote data set name\" copy and paste the filename but exclude the csv file extension (churn_rate_visualization, cust_summary_notebook_training, cust_summary_visbuilder_training)\n    * Click \"Create\", the scroll down to click \"Add data set\" again, then \"Browse\" and repeat for the remaining files.\n    * When finished, click Save\n9. Verify the new data sets are accessible\n    * Click the name of your project to return to the main project screen\n    * Click \"Assets\" then click \"Data Sets\"\n    * Select \"Preview\" from the 3-dot menu to the right of each of the data sets.

Create and run the Python customer churn visualization notebook\nIn this lab section, you will create a new notebook from a file downloaded earlier, modify it to use the correct data set from HDP HDFS, and run the notebook\n1. From within your new project, either click \"Create notebook\" from the top right + menu, or click \"Add notebook\" from the assets list screen.\n2. Select \"From File\"\n3. At the bottom of the screen click \"browse\", select the __Churn+Visualization+Python+HDP.ipynb__ file (the plus signs were added when you downloaded the file), and click \"Open\".   The \"Name\" field is automatically filled in.  (*You can remove the plus signs from the name if you would like to but it is not necessary*)\n4. Click \"Create\" and a \"Launching Jupyter\" message will be displayed.  __This message may last for a couple minutes, please be patient__\n5. Once the notebook opens, you will see a series of cells that have not yet been run.  Perform the following steps in order:\n    1. Click inside the first cell at the top of the notebook and then click the \"Run\" icon in the toolbar (__>|__).  Within the brackets to the left of the cell, you should see an \\* appear and then change to the number \"1\".  This indicates the cell was run successfully.\n    2. Now click in the cell below, where you will see a \"TODO\" comment.  Click just below the \"TODO\" comment, so the cursor is on the blank line below.  \n    3. Now click the \"*1001*\" \"Find data\" icon above on the right in the toolbar.  The \"Find data\" menu opens, click on \"Remote\" and you will see a list of datasets\n    4. Underneath the \"churn_rate_visualization\" data set, click the dropdown arrow and select \"__Insert Pandas DataFrame__\".  *(If you don't see this option then see the note below)* Code to load the dataset from HDP HDFS will automatically be inserted into the cell where the cursor was positioned.  Now close the \"Find data\" menu by clicking the \"X\" on the left side of the menu.  \n    > NOTE:  There is a possible bug here that you may need to work around.  If you see *Insert Spark DataFrame in R* in the dropdown (instead of the Python options) then you will need to close the notebook by clicking on the project name, stop the notebook's kernel by selecting \"stop kernel\" from the 3-dot menu to the right of the notebook, then reopen the notebook and restart from step A above (rerun cell 1).\n    5. After the pandas code is automatically inserted, run the cell by clicking the \"Run\" icon in the toolbar (__>|__).  You should see the tabular output of the dataframe.head() statement displayed in the cell output.  \n    6. Click in the next cell down, find the \"TODO\" marker.  Follow the instruction, then run the cell.  You should see a Brunel visualization of the churn rate data.\n    7. Click in the next cell down, find the \"TODO\" marker.  Click on the blank line below the comment and insert the \"customer summary visualization\" dataset as a pandas dataframe by using the \"Find data\" menu as before.  After the pandas code is automatically inserted, run the cell.  You should see a tabular representation of the dataframe.head() statement in the cell output area.\n    8. Click in the next cell down, find the \"TODO\" marker.  Follow the instructions, then run the cell.  Tabular output should show customer mean income grouped by state.\n    9. Click in the next cell down, a markdown cell labeled \"Income by state\".  While this cell is selected, go to the \"Cell\" dropdown menu and select \"Run All Below\" (this runs the selected cell and all cells below it).\n    10.
