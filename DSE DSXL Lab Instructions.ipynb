Login to ambari using the credentials you noted above.\n2. Navigate to the \"Files view\" tool  (Available from the toolbar within the \"Views\" dropdown menu to the right of the \"Admin\" menu)\n2. Verify you see the assets listed in the table above in the file browser.  You will create data assets in DSX that correspond to these files.\n\n## 1.3. Download copies of required Jupyter notebooks to your personal system\nIn this step you will open an existing project in DSX Local that is shared with your user ID.  You will then open and download Jupyter notebooks to your local system so you can reuse them in the following steps.\n1. Login to DSX Local as your assigned team user.  \n2. You will see a shared project called \"BankChurn\".  *Note:  Do not perform your lab excercises in this project, you only have \"viewer\" priveleges for this project.  You will open, then download the notebooks from this project.*\n3. Click into the BankChurn project, then click \"Assets\".  You should see a list of three notebooks contained in the project.\n4. For each of the notebooks listed above, first open the notebook by clicking its link, then download it using the `File -> Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb)` menu option\n>*Note: Remember the download location for these files, you will need these files in a following step.*",
